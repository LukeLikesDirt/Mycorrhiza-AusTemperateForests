- `metadata_complete.csv` - Complete metadata merged with soil chemistry
- `fungal_taxonomy_clean.csv` - Cleaned taxonomy with consistent formatting

### Data Quality Reports
- `sequencing_depth_summary.csv` - Read counts per sample
- `data_quality_report.txt` - Summary of data cleaning steps and removed samples
